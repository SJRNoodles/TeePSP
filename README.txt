2022 noodles

since teeworlds is a really fun game, i might as well try to port it to the psp. since i can't understand teeworlds' source code, im building the game from the
ground up, so it isnt going to be an exactly pixel perfect replica.

## cool features
game works with tee skins made for version 0.6.x! all you need to do is downscale it to 128 x 64 and it will work like magic!

## todo
make ai work
add sound
make a better level
other stuff

## building
open a terminal in the src directory and type "make". itll make a EBOOT.pbp file for you to play

## putting on your psp
make a new folder in your psp's GAME folder, and call it anything you'd remember. put the assets folder in the new folder, as well as eboot.pbp. teeworlds psp should be there
when the game is installed.
